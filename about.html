        <p class="about-paras">I am just like every normal human being. Currently trying to survive in the culture-influenced country, Bangladesh. Studying MERN stack to land a "enough-to-feed-the-family" type of job. Life is hitting hard in the back, but it no longer feels heavy to get backshosts by it. Trying to get used to it. Thats all. Just a regular drop-out kid tryna persue his dream in a world where nobody gives a fuck. I am also trying Cybersecurity. You know, just as a hobby.</p>
