  <h1 class="header">A letter for you (24 December 2025)</h1>
  <div class="letter">
    <h2 class="chapter-header">Chapter 0 - Introduction</h2>
    <p class="chapters">
    <p class="paras">My love. First, I want deeply appreciate you for all your efforts to us and our relationship. We
      both know its
      not easy. I appreciate all your works and sacrifices.</p>

    <p class="paras">My love, you are one of a kind. I have never met anyone like you in my whole life. And I am so sure
      that I won't
      ever meet anyone like you in my life. You are such a brave and hardworking girl.</p>

    <p class="paras">Sweetheart. Your beauty always amaze me. When I look at you, I always wonder, "is it possible to be
      that
      beautiful?"
      Your charming smile always brings joy to my heart. Your dark beautiful eyes soften my heart. Your warm voice
      always
      calms my anger.</p>

    <p class="paras">You are the best thing that ever happened to me. I am so glad to have you in my life. You have
      changed many
      things
      of me. You are perfect for me. I am incomplete without you. I need you. I want you. I crave you.</p>

    <p class="paras">Today is your birthday. I wanted to do something special. But as you know, I am broke. So all I
      could think of is
      writing a letter to you. It's long, (hopefully) lovely, and from my heart. I hope you like it.</p>
    </p>
    <h2 class="chapter-header">Chapter 1 - The Rise</h2>
    <p class="chapters">
    <p class="paras">You remember the time we met? I fully remember. It was still dark here. Almost morning. The sun was
      rising. But I
      never thought that my life will change forever from then.</p>

    <p class="paras">We chatted. We laughed. We joked. But, in the night of 3rd june, when you started to talk about
      love and
      relationships, my heart was beating so fast. My mind was racing. I never got into that position with any other
      girl. It was something warm, heavy, and overwhelming.</p>

    <p class="paras">And when you finally said, "I love you Hamim", my heart started aching, as if it is physically
      feeling something.
      It was so overwhelming for me. I still remember that rush of emotions. Happiness, fear, love, insecurity,
      everything rushed through my heart and mind.</p>
    </p>
    <h2 class="chapter-header">Chapter 2 - The build</h2>
    <p class="chapters">
    <p class="paras">I still remember how you immediately stepped back after knowing my real age. The next day, you got
      my texts. I
      promised you that I will come to you in January or February of 2026. You texted me back, but it was not something
      to cheer about. You texted me like, "it's just your hormone", "You will lose all your interest after a while", "I
      am here as your big sister", etc. I felt bad. So bad.</p>

    <p class="paras">But only within few days, everything changed. We became normal. And in the night of 9 June, I
      simply texted you,
      "Hey, will you marry me?" You texted back "Yess. I always pray that we best Match." I felt confused. This wasn't
      suppose to be that easy. I got a girl, fell in love in 1 day, went into relationship within 3 days, proposed
      marriage within 9 days. I was asking myself,"Is it that easy and simple? No, no. There's definitely something
      wrong. And from then, I started suspecting you in everything. I was worried, "if I get emotionally attached with
      her, and she betrays me, what will I do?"</p>

    <p class="paras">But now, after this long 6 months, I finally realized it's not as easy as it looked. Visiting you,
      making your
      parents agree, marrying you, all of this isn't easy at all. But In Sha Allah, we will not give up.</p>
    </p>
    <h2 class="chapter-header">Chapter 3 - Honeymoon phase</h2>
    <p class="chapters">
    <p class="paras">You remember those times we used tk talk for 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours continously? Haha, I do. It was awesome,
      right? We are talking for hours, you don't have much works, I don't have much works. We are experiencing something
      entirely new.</p>

    <p class="paras">There was no arguments, no fights, no angers. Just love and warmth.</p>

    <p class="paras">We used to play Minecraft together. I built a house for you. We fought in the nether. Played hide and seek. I had
      a parrot. He died. I made a grave for him. Your orange cat got lost. Then we found a similar cat in Minecraft. We
      took him home, and him his nsme, Ucit. I made a very big farm. Just harvesting all the crops would take about 2
      hours in real life. I made iron farm, villager trade hall, food farm, lava farm, etc. We had horse. You rode him.
      We sometimes played while on call. Your internet was slow, but we managed any way. Remember we went for mining
      together? A bunch of zombies chased me. But I protected you though.</p>

    <p class="paras">All that laughs and funs felt endless. If you ask me, I felt like I am in a dream on that time.</p>
    </p>
    <h2 class="chapter-header">Chapter 4 - Reality check</h2>
    <p class="chapters">
      <p class="paras">It was all fun and awesome. But it started to fall. We started to argue. At first, it was few. Bur then it started
      to happen frequently. At one point, we started to argue literally every single day. I started to find out about
      things that was not comfortable to me, like your college friends, your photos with them, your makeup reels, etc.
      You started see my jealousy and anger, etc.</p>
      
      <p class="paras">I remember our argument about one of your friend, Ana. You know, from the time I know her, I felt something off.
      Something about her was itching me. But I didn't quite know what.</p>

      <p class="paras">We had many serious arguments which almost made us break up. One night, I even directly told you, "muti, I think
      we should break up."</p>

      <p class="paras">We argued about family, friends, parents, future, finance, jealousy, job, etc.</p>

      <p class="paras">We are not as excited to talk with each other as we were before. We don't do many activities together as we used
      to do before. We don't experience new things everyday as we used to do before.</p>
    </p>
    <h2 class="chapter-header">Chapter 5 - Us Forever</h2>
    <p class="chapters">
      <p class="paras">Yes, we argue. Yes, we fight. Yes we get angry. But, we never sleep without solving our problems. We never hold
      our anger. We never let our ego win. We always communicate. We always return back. We always say sorry. That's
      what make us for each other. That's what make us love each other. That's what make us choose each other over and
      over again.</p>
      
      <p class="paras">We love. We fight. We forgive. Thats how it is darling. That's how we stay together forever.</p>

      <p class="paras">You always respect me, even in the time when you are angry. I deeply appreciate you for all of those moments.</p>

      <p class="paras">You are priceless. You are the most valuable thing to me. You are the sweetest person I have ever seen. You are
      the most beautiful person I have ever seen.</p>

      <p class="paras">At the end of the day, we will always come back, no matter how big of a fight we had.</p>
    </p>
    <h2 class="chapter-header">Chapter 6 - From heart, to heart</h2>
    <p class="chapters">
      <p class="paras">Muti. My darling. I had big plans for your birthday. But, I don't have the money to afford it right now. So all I
      could do is write this to you. I know this is just texts. Its nothing big, nothing special. I am sorry darling. I
      would spend my last penny you, if I had any.</p>

      <p class="paras">Sweetheart, I have few more things to say to you.</p>

      <p class="paras">2025 almost at the end. 2026 is another new year. A new start. A fresh start. So why don't we forgive each other
      for everything, and start it fresh? Let's just do this. Let forgive each other for all the things, and say sorry
      to each other, and start it fresh. Let's change things that we don't like about each other. Let's be better for
      each other. Let's give each other a little more time, a little more affection, a little more love, a little more
      reassurance, a little for attention, a little more validation. Are you willing to do it? Answer me. If I am in
      call, answer me in call. If I am in chat, answer me in chat. Are you willing to be better for me, as I am willing
      for you? Are you willing to change yourself for me, as I am willing to change myself for you? If so, let's discuss
      it now. Let's just pick a time. And on the selected time, let's just sit down, and open mindly share each other
      everything we don't like about each other, no matter how obvious or hard it is.</p>

      <p class="paras">Its a new year. A new start. A new opportunity to be better.</p>

      <p class="paras">Just remember, at the end of the day, it's just you and me. No parents. No jobs. No kids. Just you and me, husband
      and wife.</p>

      <p class="paras">Remember, it's not about what we are gaining and losing. It's about how much we are willing to sacrifice for each
      other. Effort needs to come from both sides darling.</p>

      <p class="paras">You are my queen. My love, body, mind, all focused on you. I will protect you. I will love you. I will care for
      you.</p>
    </p>
    <p class="outro">-Your future husband, Hamim.</p>
